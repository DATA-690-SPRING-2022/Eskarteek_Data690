## Career Objective

Skilled data engineer (includes data structures, algorithms) with work experience in data management and analysis. I am seeking a challenging opportunity to work with large real-time data driven projects where I can use my advanced skills and experience to advance with the organization.

# Education Background
University of Maryland, Baltimore County, MD, United States of America

* Master of Science in Data Science	  

Great Lakes Institute of Management Chennai, India                	                                     			                                       
* Post-Graduation-Program in Data Science and Engineering	

# Projects

**Signal Detection for Adverse Drug Reaction using Twitter**

Tech Stack: Spark NLP, Spark ML, MySQL, Python, Twitter API, Tableau

*	Annotated the tweets and classify as Drug Event combination for more than a million tweets.
*	Designed a model that returns all the possible side effects caused by a certain drug for the last 10 years. 
* Identified various ADE’s for drugs with 96.6% confidence

**Stock Movement prediction using Sentient analysis on financial news**                                                                             
Tech Stack: Sentiment analysis, Supervised Learning Classification (KNN), Web Scraping.
*	This project is focused on analyzing intraday trading patterns which are highly dependent on financial news.
* Scrapped thousands of financial news articles and classified based on sentiment vector.
*	Using news sentiments and stock data, we achieved an accuracy score of 71.2% in predicting short-term stock movement.

**Weather Forecasting model**                                                                                                                                                            
Tech Stack: Time Series Analysis/ Python
*	Algorithms such as Random Forest Regression (RFR) and recurrent neural network (RNN) are used to compare accuracy and find optimal prediction. 
* Built a Long short-term memory (LSTM) which is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture.
*	Further compared with that of NASA’s weather dataset to see congruence and accuracy among both datasets.

**Fright Analysis Framework**                                                                                                                                                             
Tech Stack: Python, Tableau, Random Forest Regression, Polynomial feature, KNN Regression, Ensemble Techniques
* Describe and analyze the crucial factors that will improve freight movement and reduce congestion. 
*	Built an ML Regression model to find influential factors and prediction of value to transport with 95% accuracy.
*	 Helping the client to know if not exactly but almost the value of transporting one or many commodities to a certain location.
